Hello, I am an aspiring software engineer and this is just an example of a very simple personal website. It started out with just pure HTML that shows the history of Web Development back in the day. Personal websites of people who lived back in the day when there was just HTML used HTML alone. The same goes for the history of websites now that uses another programming languages to make their wabsites more pleasing to the eye of clients like Google, Yahoo, etc.

This is just my first stepping stone

Edit: I added a bit of CSS throughout finishing this project. I just relocated all the inline styles that were supposed to be in CSS from index.html. It was how people styled their website when there was just HTML.
